## Issues

Issues can be created on the following page: https://github.com/sabinayo/codemagic-godot-pipeline/issues

When creating an issue, please follow these guidelines:

- Choose the correct category (e.g., bug report, feature request).
- Check if a similar issue already exists. If it does, please comment there instead of opening a new one.
- Describe in detail what is happening and what needs to be fixed. If possible, add materials such as images or video.
- Use clear and descriptive titles with helpful keywords.
- Use English to ensure everyone can understand and help.
- Specify your environment (e.g., development or build mode, OS, browser if relevant, etc.).


# Style Guide

When adding content to the site (via pull request or otherwise), please follow these guidelines:

- Use headers (`#`, `##`, etc.) to organize your page into clear sections.
- Use fenced code blocks with proper language identifiers (e.g.Â `bash`, `yaml`, `js`).
- Prefer concise, clear explanations using bullet points or step-by-step instructions.
- At the top of each page, include a **short summary** of what the tutorial covers.  
  At the end, include a brief **recap** and a **"Getting Help and Support"** section (if applicable).
- If your page presents a configuration file, make it **downloadable** when possible (e.g., with a link).
- Always **credit any assets or content** you use that you did not create yourself.


# Create a pull request

When creating a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

- Clearly describe what the modification does, why it's needed, and how it works.
- Check for existing pull requests to avoid duplicates.
- Write all content in English.
- Be prepared to make changes: a maintainer will review and test your code before merging.  
  This process may take some time, and feedback or clarification may be requested in the comments.
