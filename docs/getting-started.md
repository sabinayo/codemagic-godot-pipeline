# Getting Started

<br>

This site guides you step-by-step to integrate Codemagic into your Godot projects through a series of tutorials. These tutorials are fully designed for Godot 4. However, in most cases, they can be adapted for Godot 3.

**Important Note**: The tutorials provided on this site are intended as examples.
Depending on your project's structure, you may need to make specific adjustments.

**This website is in no way affiliated with Codemagic or Godot.** It is a third-party site designed to offer a guide for using Codemagic with Godot. If you encounter any issues, please report them on the site's [GitHub page](https://github.com/sabinayo/codemagic-godot-pipeline/issues).

**The steps outlined in each tutorial offer general advice rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. However, they will provide you with a solid starting point for writing a `codemagic.yaml` file tailored to your Godot project.**

As this website is still under development, a dedicated tutorial for Godot 3 may be added later. In the meantime, feel free to check out [Godot 3 CI-CD](https://blog.codemagic.io/godot-games-cicd/) for a detailed guide on exporting to macOS with Godot 3 using Codemagic.
