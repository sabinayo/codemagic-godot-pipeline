## Get the source code

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabinayo/codemagic-godot-pipeline.git
```

## Run the Website Locally (Development Mode)

Make sure you have [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started#installation) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  
Then run the following command from the root of the project directory:
```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

> You can also use `pnpm`, `yarn` or `bun`. See the [Vitepress Installation Guide](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started) for more options.

This will start a live-reloading server where you can preview and edit the site in real-time.


## Build and preview Locally

Before deploying, you can test the production build locally by running the following command from the root of the project directory:
```bash
npm run docs:build && npm run docs:preview
```
